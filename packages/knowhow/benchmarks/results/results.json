Here's a summary of the work completed:\n\n1. **Function Implementation**: The `accumulate` function was implemented to apply a given operation on each element of an input collection without using built-in mapping functions.\n\n2. **Test Cases**: Several test cases were written in `accumulate.spec.js` to verify the functionality including -  \n   - Handling of an empty collection\n   - Accumulating squares of numbers \n   - Converting words to uppercase \n   - Reversing strings \n   - Accumulating recursively \n\n3. **Test Execution**: The test suite was executed, confirming that all tests passed without any issues. \n\nThe implementation is now complete and ready for use."
